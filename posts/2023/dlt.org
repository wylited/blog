* dlt - delta

why *delta* for the 2023 icon?

The fourth greek letter delta, used all over the place as a symbol, is majorly used to symbolize change.

The year of 2023, I believe has brought (or will bring) the most change for me. You could include 2022, but its no longer 2022 so I might as well just start a new.
