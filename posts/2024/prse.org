prse -> prose

2024 continuation.

 ----------
Summer rain, relentless yet timeless, \\
breaks away from the perpetual. \\
like hands on a clock ticking back, quite fast, \\
I seem stuck in my own past. \\

pitter patter, faster than you can say, \\
washes away all that remains. \\
a wind of cool, diverging the heatwaves; \\
let the reverb of the static, push you away. \\

Yet, the sticky air, \\
befalls me thereafter. \\
The comfort only bringing exasperation; \\
the passing rain, never endless. \\

tick tock
theres little left on the clock
where will i fight
when i run out of time

tick tock
battering the wall
till the cathartic release
of blood dripping off my palms

allons-y
to quite far from here
allons-l√†
