2024 continuation.

<p>
Summer rain, relentless yet timeless, <br />
breaks away from the perpetual. <br />
like hands on a clock ticking back, quite fast, <br />
I seem stuck in my own past. <br />
</p>

<p>
pitter patter, faster than you can say, <br />
washes away all that remains. <br />
a wind of cool, diverging the heatwaves; <br />
let the reverb of the static, push you away. <br />
</p>

<p>
Yet, the sticky air, <br />
befalls me thereafter. <br />
The comfort only bringing exasperation; <br />
the passing rain, never endless. <br />

tick tock
theres little left on the clock
where will i fight
when i run out of time
</p>

<p>
tick tock
battering the wall
till the cathartic release
of blood dripping off my palms
</p>

<p>
allons-y
to quite far from here
allons-l√†
