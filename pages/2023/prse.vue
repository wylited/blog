prse -&gt; prose
</p>

<p>
a collection of short stuff I wrote, not long enough to be anything of substance or value.

<p>
I dont like this one but.//
im just a shoulder to you?//
no./
a shoulder to cry on,//
go on, lean on me.//
learn to//
love to live as a glorified wall//
make sure to put on some fat,//
so its nice to sleep on as well.//
but i cannot complain, if i request it.//
just let me be more,//
maybe a human a whole.//

persistent weed, in the crack, <i>/
shallow pool, reflecting attacks. /</i>
spalling concrete, resilient shelter <i>/
but you wont buckle, under the pressure /</i>

ways to lose memories: <i>/
you forget which key, you use for the safe /</i>
you forget the safe number, and you cant test your key with every safe <i>/
you give the safe to someone else, and they run away with it /</i>
you lock the safe, within another safe, within another safe, and antoher safe, and throw away all the keys <i>/
you throw the safe further into the future, for a later you to deal with /</i>

things that remind me of you &amp; the small things you do //
</p>

<p>
is it <i>/
standing in the rain, holding a black umbrella /</i>
that's alike to texting you, from the comfort of my bed. <i>/
or was it /</i>
staring out of the window, into the darkness of the storm. <i>/
the soft words you spoke, wrapping my head. /</i>
the touch of your cold hands, that you use to write <i>/
extravagant fortresses of sweet, sweet rambling. /</i>
the touch of cold stone under my neck, the blossom of blood spreading from it. //

<p>
you remind me <i>/
of a ghost, That i dont get to see. /</i>
appearing every todays, whispering in my ear. <i>/
she sacrified her face, for not fortune nor fame. /</i>
a deal made with someone worse than the devil. <i>/
a deal made with her irrationally driven self. /</i>
for someone who daily deal is in logic, <i>/
I wonder how one could be so stupid. /</i>

I dont get to see <i>/
pretty clouds often enough /</i>
but fortunately <i>/
i can see you /</i>
</p>


<p>
every day and night <i>/
somewhere only we know /</i>

when you speak of warmth, you make me feel it, but you end up losing it. <i>/
so why do I speak of warmth when I'm hot headed? /</i>

<p>
I think i need some sedative <i>/
falling victim to the scheduled /</i>
it all feels too repetitive <i>/
"go buy some milk again" /</i>
rise before the sun, work my stress away <i>/
try to make the most of the next hour /</i>
living life on the daytoday <i>/
never gonna falter, but let me sway /</i>
from side to side //

for i am too tired to argue /</i>
and if i do argue <i>/
you will end up tireder than me /</i>
for exhausting is all i can do //
