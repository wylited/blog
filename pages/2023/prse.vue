<p>
prse -&gt; prose
</p>

<p>
a collection of short stuff I wrote, not long enough to be anything of substance or value.
</p>




<hr />

<p>
persistent weed, in the crack,
</p>

<p>
shallow pool, reflecting attacks.
</p>

<p>
spalling concrete, resilient shelter
</p>

<p>
but you wont buckle, under the pressure
</p>

<p>
ways to lose memories:
</p>

<p>
you forget which key, you use for the safe
</p>

<p>
you forget the safe number, and you cant test your key with every safe
</p>

<p>
you give the safe to someone else, and they run away with it
</p>

<p>
you lock the safe, within several other safes, and throw away all the keys
</p>

<p>
you throw the safe further into the future, for a later you to deal with
</p>

<p>
things that remind me of you &amp; the small things you do
</p>

<p>
is it
</p>

<p>
standing in the rain, holding a black umbrella
</p>

<p>
that's alike to texting you, from the comfort of my bed.
</p>

<p>
or was it
</p>

<p>
staring out of the window, into the darkness of the storm.
</p>

<p>
the soft words you speak, wrapping my head.
</p>

<p>
the touch of your cold hands, that you use to write
</p>

<p>
extravagant fortresses of sweet, sweet rambling.
</p>

<p>
the touch of cold stone under my neck, the blossom of blood spreading from it.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
you remind me
</p>

<p>
of a ghost, That i dont get to see.
</p>

<p>
appearing every todays, whispering in my ear.
</p>

<p>
she sacrified her face, for no fortune nor fame.
</p>

<p>
a deal made with someone worse than the devil.
</p>

<p>
a deal made with her irrationally driven self.
</p>

<p>
for someone who thinks and breathes in logic,
</p>

<p>
I wonder how one could be so stupid.
</p>

<p>
I dont get to see
</p>

<p>
pretty clouds often enough
</p>

<p>
but fortunately
</p>

<p>
i can see you
</p>


<p>
every day and night
</p>

<p>
somewhere only we know
</p>

<hr />

<p>
when you speak of warmth, you make me feel it , but then you end up losing it.
</p>

<p>
so why do I speak of warmth when I'm hot headed?
</p>

<p>

<hr />

<p>
I think i need some sedative
</p>

<p>
falling victim to the scheduled
</p>

<p>
it all feels too repetitive
</p>

<p>
"go buy some milk again"
</p>

<p>
rise before the sun, work my stress away
</p>

<p>
try to make the most of the next hour
</p>

<p>
living life on the daytoday
</p>

<p>
never gonna falter, but let me sway
</p>

<p>
from side to side
</p>

<p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>

</p>
