prse -&gt; prose
</p>

<p>
a collection of short stuff I wrote, not long enough to be anything real.
</p>

<hr />

<p>
persistent weed, in the crack,
shallow pool, reflecting attacks.
spalling concrete, resilient shelter
but you wont buckle, under the pressure

ways to lose memories:
you forget which key, you use for the safe
you forget the safe number, and you cant test your key with every safe
you give the safe to someone else, and they run away with it
you lock the safe, within several other safes, and throw away all the keys
you throw the safe further into the future, for a later you to deal with

things that remind me of you &amp; the small things you do
is it
standing in the rain, holding a black umbrella
that's alike to texting you, from the comfort of my bed.
or was it
staring out of the window, into the darkness of the storm.
the soft words you speak, wrapping my head.
the touch of your cold hands, that you use to write
extravagant fortresses of sweet, sweet rambling.
the touch of cold stone under my neck, the blossom of blood spreading from it.

you remind me
of a ghost, That i dont get to see.
appearing every todays, whispering in my ear.
she sacrified her face, for no fortune nor fame.
a deal made with someone worse than the devil.
a deal made with her irrationally driven self.
for someone who thinks and breathes in logic,
I wonder how one could be so stupid.

I dont get to see
pretty clouds often enough
but fortunately
i can see you
every day and night
somewhere only we know

when you speak of warmth, you feel it, then you lose it.
so why do I speak of warmth when I'm hot headed?

I think i need some sedative
falling victim to the scheduled
it all feels too repetitive
"go buy some milk again"
rise before the sun, work my stress away
try to make the most of the next hour
living life on the daytoday
never gonna falter, but let me sway
from side to side

<p>
leave me be
for i am too tired to argue
and if i do argue
you will end up tireder than me
for that is all i can do
