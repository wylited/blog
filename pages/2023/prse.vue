prse -&gt; prose
</p>

<p>
a collection of short stuff I wrote, not long enough to be anything of substance or value.
</p>

<p>
I dont like this one but.  <br />
im just a shoulder to you?  <br />
no. <br />
a shoulder to cry on,  <br />
go on, lean on me.  <br />
learn to  <br />
love to live as a glorified wall  <br />
make sure to put on some fat,  <br />
so its nice to sleep on as well.  <br />
but i cannot complain, if i request it.  <br />
just let me be more,  <br />
maybe a human a whole.  <br />

<p>
persistent weed, in the crack,   <br />
shallow pool, reflecting attacks.   <br />
spalling concrete, resilient shelter   <br />
but you wont buckle, under the pressure   <br />

<p>
ways to lose memories:   <br />
you forget which key, you use for the safe   <br />
you forget the safe number, and you cant test your key with every safe   <br />
you give the safe to someone else, and they run away with it   <br />
you lock the safe, within another safe, within another safe, and antoher safe, and throw away all the keys   <br />
you throw the safe further into the future, for a later you to deal with   <br />

<p>
things that remind me of you &amp; the small things you do   <br />
</p>

<p>
is it   <br />
standing in the rain, holding a black umbrella   <br />
that's alike to texting you, from the comfort of my bed.   <br />
or was it   <br />
staring out of the window, into the darkness of the storm.   <br />
the soft words you spoke, wrapping my head.   <br />
the touch of your cold hands, that you use to write   <br />
extravagant fortresses of sweet, sweet rambling.   <br />
the touch of cold stone under my neck, the blossom of blood spreading from it.   <br />
</p>

<p>
you remind me   <br />
of a ghost, That i dont get to see.   <br />
appearing every todays, whispering in my ear.   <br />
she sacrified her face, for not fortune nor fame.   <br />
a deal made with someone worse than the devil.   <br />
a deal made with her irrationally driven self.   <br />
for someone who daily deal is in logic,   <br />
I wonder how one could be so stupid.   <br />

<p>
I dont get to see   <br />
pretty clouds often enough   <br />
but fortunately   <br />
i can see you   <br />
</p>


<p>
every day and night   <br />
somewhere only we know   <br />
</p>

<p>
when you speak of warmth, you make me feel it, but you end up losing it.   <br />
so why do I speak of warmth when I'm hot headed?   <br />

<p>
I think i need some sedative   <br />
falling victim to the scheduled   <br />
it all feels too repetitive   <br />
"go buy some milk again"   <br />
rise before the sun, work my stress away   <br />
try to make the most of the next hour   <br />
living life on the daytoday   <br />
never gonna falter, but let me sway   <br />
from side to side   <br />
</p>
