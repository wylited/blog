<p>
I think I may <br />
fall in love in October <br />
but as halloween comes around <br />
I'm too spooked <br />
to walk down these roads <br />
 <br />
So I decide to run. <br />
run hard, run fast, run long <br />
run till the thoughts in my head <br />
freeze just like the weather. <br />
</p>

<p>
Another month goes by, <br />
and your Merino red sweater <br />
is pulled over my bear chest <br />
I mark the 3rd <br />
on the calendar <br />
a sweet reminder <br />
</p>

<p>
you and me are like glue <br />
radiating our way through the bitter cold <br />
leaving behind a sweeter road. <br />
you tell me of your past <br />
I make you my present <br />
we can only dream of a future together. <br />
</p>

<p>
3 months pass by <br />
the flowers we planted in full bloom <br />
the colors rich, and the petals a plenty <br />
we dance around <br />
our home <br />
rhythmic clicks linoleum tiles <br />
</p>

<p>
but I guess, <br />
4 is unlucky, the Chinese warn <br />
you leave a ghost, <br />
and I lose, my you. <br />
</p>

<p>
The flowers we planted, <br />
Have no fruits to bear <br />
Nevertheless I grasp on <br />
to the stems of the roses. <br />
The long heat comes <br />
with that the drying of leaves too <br />
I remain confined in my room <br />
in a coma, on my desk <br />
studying reading writing <br />
distracting myself <br />
from everything about you. <br />
</p>

<p>
As the fall rolls around <br />
and the heat waves end. <br />
I become love sick with you <br />
once again. <br />
I dance alone in the kitchen <br />
wishing my feet would dance <br />
like they did with you. <br />
I would have died for you, <br />
but you already did for me <br />
</p>
