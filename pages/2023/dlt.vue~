<p>
why choose <b>delta</b> for the 2023 icon?
</p>

<p>
The fourth greek letter delta, used all over the place as a symbol, is majorly used to symbolize change.

<p>
The year of 2023, I believe has brought (or will bring) the most change for me. I would want to include 2022, but its no longer 2022, so I might as well just start anew.</p>
