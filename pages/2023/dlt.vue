<p>
why <b>delta</b> for the 2023 icon?
</p>

<p>
The fourth greek letter delta, used all over the place as a symbol, is majorly used to symbolize change.
</p>

<p>
The year of 2023, I believe has brought (or will bring) the most change for me. You could include 2022, but its no longer 2022 so I might as well just start a new.</p>
